# Cross Stitch Skeins Organizer

The goal of this program is to convert DMC skeins to Anchor and vice versa. Also, it lets you know how many skeins you have available for a certain skein number. The DMC and Anchor skeins are used for cross stitch work.

When the file SkeinOrganizer is executed, the following options are displayed:
1. Convert a DMC skein to Anchor
2. Convert an Anchor skein to DMC
3. Convert many DMC skeins to Anchor
4. Check if I have this skein available (only one skein)
5. Check if I have these skeins available (many skeins)
6. Exit program

The program will keep running until the last option is selected.

In order to update the skeins that you have available, you need to modify the anchor_skeins.txt file and the dmc_skeins.txt. The first value is the number of the skein and the second number is the quantity you have available.
